# TechyBlogs: MERN Stack App
Full site: https://techyblog2021.herokuapp.com/ .      A template tech blog app using the React, Express, Mongo and
                  Nodejs. This app showcases my knowledge of the fullstack side
                  of web development.
                  Uses bootstrap, and redux in the frontend with REST APIs and
                  authentication in the backend.
                  
# What I Learned 
 For this project I solidified my understanding of MERN and how all the technologies in the backend and frontend integrate to become one app. I learned a lot about REST APIs and how to use CRUD functions for my mongo database. 

I also learned about redux in this app and how it's helpful in managing state at an app level. I saw the importance of middleware and how it allows you to use the same functionality for different routes. Additionally I discovered helpful libraries like multer and cloudinary for image stoarge as well as passportjs for authentication. My favorite discovery for this app was the TinyMCE library, I really enjoyed implenting it and its functionality.
